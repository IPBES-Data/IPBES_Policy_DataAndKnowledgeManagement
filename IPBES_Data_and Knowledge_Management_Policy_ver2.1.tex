\section{Preamble}

The \gls{plenary} of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), in section II of its decision IPBES-2/5, established a \textit{task force} on knowledge and data for the period of its first work programme 2014‒2018. In decision IPBES-3/1, section II, the \gls{plenary} approved the data and information management plan set out in annex II to the same decision. At its seventh session, in decision IPBES-7/1, section II, the \gls{plenary} adopted the rolling work programme of the Platform up to 2030, which included among its six objectives objective 3 (a), advanced work \textit{on knowledge and data}. In section IV of its decision IPBES-7/1, the \textit{Plenary }recalled the establishment of the \textit{task force} and extended its mandate for the implementation of objective 3 (a) of the rolling work programme of the Platform up to 2030, in accordance with the revised terms of reference set out in annex II to the same decision, and requested the \gls{bureau} and \gls{mep}, through the \textit{IPBES secretariat} to constitute the \textit{task force} in accordance with the terms of reference. According to its terms of reference, the \textit{task force} on knowledge and data oversees and takes part in the implementation of objective 3 (a) of the rolling work programme up to 2030 and acts in accordance with relevant decisions by the \gls{plenary} and its subsidiary bodies. Its mandate includes, among other things, to guide the \textit{secretariat}, including the dedicated \textit{technical support unit}, in the management of the \textit{data}, information and knowledge used in \gls{ipbesproducts}, including the development of the web-based infrastructure, to ensure their long-term availability and data interoperability.

In line with this mandate, the \textit{task force} on knowledge and data drafted and, upon approval by the \gls{mep} and \gls{bureau} at their 14th meetings in January 2020, published the first version of the IPBES data management policy (version 1.0). The \textit{task force }revised the policy in September 2020 and published the revision (version 1.1) after approval by the \textit{Multidisciplinary Expert Panel }and \textit{Bureau } at their 15th meetings in November 2020. The data management policy was presented to the \textit{Plenary }in document IPBES-8/INF/12. The \gls{plenary}, in decision IPBES-8/1 section IV, took note of the data management policy, as presented. The data management policy was further revised in 2021 and the task force on knowledge and data published the IPBES data and knowledge management policy (version 2.0) after approval by the \textit{Multidisciplinary Expert Panel }and \textit{Bureau }at their 18th meetings in February 2022.

The purpose of the policy is to provide overarching guidance on the management of \textit{data and knowledge }to current assessments and the work of \textit{task forces} regarding \gls{ipbesproducts}. The policy is grounded in the principles of open science, accessibility, and building knowledge through partnerships.

\section{Introduction}

This policy builds on the data and information management plan approved by the \textit{IPBES Plenary} set out in annex II to decision IPBES-3/1 and the terms of reference of the \textit{task force} set out in annex II to decision IPBES-7/1. In particular, it builds on the activity “reviewing and developing data and metadata guidelines”, and is grounded in its principles for “managing knowledge, information, and data” in the Platform, in particular accessibility, and open science. Definitions of the terms used throughout this policy can be found in annex I.

\textbf{Open science}. The open science approach promotes the generation of \textit{knowledge }through collaboration based on free and open access to \textit{knowledge}, information, and \textit{data}. Open science, therefore, ensures that the work of all the \textit{experts} and \textit{stakeholders} involved is fully recognized, properly attributed, documented, and preserved. Adoption of these principles and of this approach means a significant cultural change in the ways in which science is done and scientific results and underlying \textit{data} are shared publicly by authors, journals and research organizations and thus made relevant to society. In the context of the Platform, the open science approach could engender very significant advances in \textit{data} integration, analysis and interpretation and could lead to a better understanding of nature and its contribution to a good quality of life. Two key aspects of open science are “accessibility” and “inclusivity and \textit{collective benefit}”.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accessibility.} Free and open access to its deliverables and to the material on which they are based is a core value of the Platform. Consequently, the policy will aim for open, permanent access to \textit{data} and information sources for its deliverables (e.g., in the scientific literature) with minimal restrictions; enforce the use of common and accessible file formats in the Platform’s deliverables; emphasize the need to communicate the availability of \textit{data} and information; and, facilitate multilingual discovery and sharing of \textit{data} and information. The Platform acknowledges that making \textit{data} and information accessible may not always mean it is always accessible to all IPBES members and\textit{ stakeholders}, including IPLCs, as technical, economical, political or any other reasons may limit the accessibility, but not its findability.
    \item \textbf{Inclusivity and }\textit{\textbf{collective benefit}}\textbf{.} Cooperation in \textit{research} and broad acceptance of the resulting \gls{ipbesproducts} is essential for the Platform to fulfil its mandate. For the acceptance and cooperation of \textit{stakeholders} and \textit{data and knowledge holders}, inclusivity in all stages of the \textit{research} is essential, and IPBES takes many steps to try to enhance participation beyond only scientific researchers. IPBES acknowledges the richness of diverse knowledge systems and epistemologies and diversity of knowledge holders and producers, including ILK and IPLCs; also outlined in the \gls{unescoopenscience}.
\end{itemize}

Thus, \textit{data and knowledge }management within IPBES should be based on UNEP’s over-arching strategies, policies and guidelines, to the maximum extent possible within the mandate of the Platform, allowing IPBES members and \textit{stakeholders}, \textit{IPLCs} and other interested parties to use and access \gls{ipbesproducts}, and \textit{knowledge and data} gathered or documented during their production and consequently derive benefit from them. IPBES has recognised the importance of \textit{indigenous and local knowledge }(ILK) to the conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems, and the procedures and protocols to be used with regard to ILK and IPLCs have been developed in detail. From its inception, the Platform aims to enhance inter-relationships and complementarities between different knowledge systems.

\section{Objectives}

To fulfil its function to generate transparent assessments, IPBES is committed to implementing \textit{data and knowledge} management procedures that are discipline-appropriate, practical, cost-effective and sustainable, and supportive of its objectives. The data and knowledge management policy is the primary reference document for IPBES \textit{data and knowledge }management\textit{.} It serves to ensure that \textit{data and knowledge} is managed correctly and consistently, and is maintained to the highest possible standard. The data and knowledge management policy has the following objectives:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item To ensure that \textit{data and knowledge} produced during IPBES \textit{research }activities, within as well as between assessments, follow the \textit{FAIR }and \textit{CARE principles to the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform};
    
    \item To ensure that \gls{ipbesproducts}, to the maximum extent possible within the mandate of the Platform, are openly available and designed so they are accessible; allowing all scientists, IPBES members, IPLCs and others to use them and consequently derive benefit from them.
    
    \item To provide a framework for all IPBES entities, including \textit{technical support units} and \textit{experts, }to fulfil their responsibilities with respect to management, handling, preservation, and distribution of \textit{data and knowledge }and \textit{generated data} within the Platform;
    
    \item To guide the \textit{experts }to fulfil their responsibilities to develop one or more \textit{data and knowledge management reports }which fulfil the requirements of this policy;
    
    \item To provide a suggested \textit{workflow} for long-term storage and preservation of \gls{ipbesproducts} to the \textit{experts};
    
    \item To promote the usage of open-source software to enable users to recreate and use \gls{ipbesproducts} without limitations.
\end{enumerate}


\section{General Principles}

To the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform, \gls{ipbesproducts} and associated \textit{research} should be managed following the \textit{FAIR and CARE principles} throughout their life cycle in line with the commitment to open science and accessibility.

\gls{ipbesproducts} and associated research relating to \textit{IPLCs} or incorporating \textit{indigenous and local knowledge}, will follow IPBES’s approach to recognising and working with \textit{indigenous and local knowledge }(Annex II to decision IPBES-5/1).

\gls{ipbesproducts} which follow the \textit{FAIR }and\textit{ CARE }principles \textit{to the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform} are essential for fulfilling the functions of IPBES, to perform regular and timely assessments of \textit{knowledge} on nature, its contribution to good quality of life, and their interlinkages, in a transparent and reproducible manner.

In the management, handling, and delivery of \gls{ipbesproducts}, national law should be respected, which includes rights of privacy, intellectual property rights, data governance regulations, and duties of confidentiality as well as other legal obligations to which IPBES has agreed as binding upon IPBES and that fall outside the scope of this policy. \textit{IPBES products }should be anonymized, if necessary, before long-term storage and publication.

IPBES is committed to providing guidance to all \textit{experts }associated with IPBES to ensure that they are aware of and follow IPBES procedures, which will aim to follow the \textit{FAIR and CARE principles} to the fullest extent possible within the mandate of the Platform.

\section{Application}

IPBES will apply this policy to all new and ongoing \gls{ipbesproducts} and related \textit{research}. The policy should be reviewed at least every 2 years by the \textit{task force }on knowledge and data to align with new developments concerning \textit{data and knowledge management and}\textit{FAIR }and\textit{ CARE }data principles.

Exceptions and deviations to this policy have to be agreed upon in the \textit{data and knowledge management report} in writing and shared with \textit{secretariat }and the \textit{technical support unit }on knowledge and data\textit{.}

\section{Scope}

This policy applies to all \gls{ipbesproducts}. \textit{IPBES experts }are required to abide by the terms and conditions agreed with third parties. IPBES also recognizes that such third parties’ policies are evolving and that the latter may require higher levels of data accessibility and dissemination in the future.

\section{Compliance and enforcement}

Compliance with the data and knowledge management policy is mandatory for all IPBES entities involved in the preparation of the \gls{ipbesproducts}. Compliance will be monitored by the \textit{technical support unit} on knowledge and data. Products will not be accepted as \gls{ipbesproducts} unless they comply with this policy.
